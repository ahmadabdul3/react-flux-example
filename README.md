# password-service
This is the completed project for the password service.

***The logic for the password 'strength' is directly inside the react component, 
if it should be a back-end service please let me know before accepting the
pull request and I can update the project***

### Build Steps
This app runs on a node+express back-end. After cloning the repo:

1. run 'cd password-service' (go into the project root folder)
2. run 'sudo npm install' (this will download all dependencies that the project needs)
3. wait for dependencies to finish installing (~ 1 minute)
4. run 'npm run serve' (this will create a build.js file, and start the server)
5. wait 2-5 seconds then navigate to 'localhost:3000' in your browser
6. hopefully no errors :) and you can type into the password input box
