# Password Service

### Description

We should be as helpful to our users as possible. When selecting passwords we
should tell them if they've selected a good password. Your job is to implement
a system to help our users select a good password.

* Implement a service that will receive the password and return either `weak`,
  `ok` or `strong.`
* Implement a front end that will show the user the strength of their password
  as they are typing.

### Implementation Notes

Acceptable implementation languages are Ruby, Python, Javascript, Java, and Scala. You may use any language framework readily available to you - Rails, Sinatra or Express.js for example.

Any design decisions not specified herein are fair game. Completed projects will be evaluated on their design, and cleanliness of implementation.

Completed projects must include a README with enough instructions for evaluators to build and run the code. Bonus points for builds which require minimal manual steps.

Remember this project should take a maximum of 4 hours to complete. Do not get hung up on scaling or persistence issues. This is a project used to evaluate your design and coding skills only.
